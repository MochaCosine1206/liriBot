Node JS Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface

The object of this project is to provide information when users ask certain questions in the command line.

For example:
 - movie-this The Matrix, should return information about the movie, "The Matrix".
 ![movie-this]
 - concert this "Artist" will return information about concerts the artist is having.
 ![concert-this]
 
 - spotify-this-song strawberry fields will return artist and albumn info for the song "Strawberry Fields".
 ![spotify-this-song]
 
   - if users choose not to enter a song, they get a nasty message about "The Sign" by Ace of Base.
   ![spotify-this-blank]
   
 -If users enter the command "do-what-it-says" spotify information about "I want it that way" is logged to the console.
 ![do-what-it-says]
 
 All of these are additionally logged to a .txt file for users to reference later if they want to go back and see what they searched for.
